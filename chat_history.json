Anxiety can show up as worrying a lot, trouble sleeping, feeling nervous around others, or even having physical symptoms like headaches or a racing heart[5][7][9]. Sometimes, things like academic stress, being away from family, or not getting enough sleep can make it worse[1][2][8]. It’s okay to take small steps to feel better, like talking to someone you trust, practicing deep breathing, or making time for things you enjoy[4]. If your anxiety feels overwhelming, remember that reaching out for support is a sign of strength, not weakness.\n\nIs there something specific making you feel anxious right now?"
